# SBM vol. #25 - Q&A with Bill Laboon, Tomasz Waszczyk [English]

## :memo: Agenda

During 30 minutes long session, I will ask questions to Bill Laboon regarding Polkadot. Feel free to suggest question via https://github.com/TomaszWaszczyk/silesia-blockchain-meetup/issues/new or just send me via social media.

Recording will be available on YouTube.

## :rocket: Prelegent

*Bill Laboon* is the Director of Education and Community at Web3 Foundation. Before this, he was a lecturer in the Computer Science Department of the University of Pittsburgh, teaching courses in software quality assurance, software engineering, and blockchain technology. He is a frequent speaker at conferences on a variety of topics, including cryptocurrency, software quality, and the ethics of software development. He is the author of two books: A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing, an undergraduate textbook; and Strength in Numbers, a near-future novel set in a world in which cryptocurrency has eliminated traditional money.  Bill has a BS in Computer Science and Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh, as well as an MS in Software Design & Management from Carnegie Mellon University.

## :question: Questions to Bill

1. Do you think that a proxy account in Polkadot is an idea for a business?
2. I understand parathread as a lamba function in Azure, but what is a practical usage in Polkadot? Any practical example?
3. What are current mailstones and goals?
4. DOTs/KSMs collected in crowdloan can be staked by projects?
5. There is a plan for more than two relay chains?
6. [Figment](https://www.notion.so/Polkadot-902169706b8a449cbd6d0b8c9a69249f) - there are any special rules to run WND validator?
7. Onboarding wallet app - do you have some well implemented onboarded app that - I guess that one of the most important thing is to deliver easy way to onboard app.
8. Systems like Polkadot are a new form of (digital) countries - any comment?
9. Does token economy is able to take over the power over individual person? What impact on society has token economy?
10. From your point of view - what is the status of ethics in software engineering today?

# SBM vol. #23 - subsocial as an example of Web3, Alex Siman

<p align="center">
  <img src="./_PREVIOUS_MEETUPS/22-10-2020-Polkadot/subsocial.png">
</p>

## :memo: Agenda

Subsocial is a set of Substrate pallets with web UI that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized censorship-resistant social network aka community. You can think of it as a decentralized version of Reddit or Medium, where a set of subreddits or blogs on Medium run on their own chain.

## :rocket: Prelegent

*Alex Siman* founder of Subsocial and DappForce. We talked about the ideas behing the project, the concept of Subsocial and near future plans. 

## :link: Links about subsocial.network

https://readymag.com/joaji/parachain/

## :question: Questions

1. Deployment of frontend - does it matter where the frontend is deployed?

2. How consensus in SubSocial is reached? Do you have collators?

3. [curiosity] Have you ever consider to implement "social" pallet? Does it make sense? In the frontend space there are many component so why not here? Maybe, maybe not.

4. [Connections frozen] Some issue with connection to Substrate (remember and research)

## :memo: Agenda

What is Polkadot ?

Polkadot is a sharded, multichain network founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of Ethereum and creator of the Solidity programming language. After three years of design and implementation, Polkadot is currently in the middle of its mainnet launch process that began in May 2020. The Polkadot network is a metaprotocol that solves many challenges that have hindered the growth of legacy blockchains, including scalability, governance, security, and interoperability. Polkadot is a blockchain network fostered by the Web3 Foundation and built by industry-leading developers at Parity Technologies.

## :rocket: Prelegent

Tomasz Waszczyk - A couple of words about my professional life: I graduated from (but my brain was not broken..) Silesian University of Technology in Poland and Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München - Duales Studium Wirtschaftsmathematik in Germany. At universities I discovered how empowering it can be to build applications and thus built several smaller and bigger applications in different programming languages, domains and platforms from industrial solutions for Volkswagen A.G. to financial solutions for traders in hedge fund.

## Podcast RelayChain

https://relaychain.fm/ ==> https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-relay-chain-48876090/

Relay Chain is a podcast covering blockchain development and building the decentralized web. We focus on the cutting edge of blockchain tech, including Substrate and Polkadot.

Brought to you by Parity Technologies, a core blockchain infrastructure company. Parity is creating an open-source creative commons that will enable people to create better institutions through technology.

Really good podcast with best quality knowledge regarding Polkadot ecosystem.

## :rocket: Validator and nomination :rocket:

Kusama network launched in July 2019 as an early, unaudited version of Polkadot’s codebase. The network has increased its validators from 25 at launch to 700 validators, with a motion recently passed that will increase that further to 900. We’re on the way to achieving our original goal of decentralizing Kusama by scaling to one thousand validator nodes. To support Kusama’s validator growth, we launched the Thousand Validators Programme at the beginning of 2020. This programme was extended in December 2020 to allow participants to run multiple eligible nodes. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./_PREVIOUS_MEETUPS/22-10-2020-Polkadot/Kusama1000.png">

I am honest validator and want to be involved in building healthy network. The name of the validator is `thirdwave-network-validator`.

## Polkadot Decoded

https://decoded.polkadot.network/

## :question: Questions

1. W CoinmarketCap widniej Total Suply 9 651 217 KSM. Circulating Supply 8 470 098 KSM a Reported Circulating Supply 8 597 990 KSM. Jak to w końcu jest z ilością coinów w obiegu?
2. j/w - w takim razie skąd biorą się kolejne tokeny? Jest ich z góry ograniczona liczba czy nieograniczona?
3. Slashes - wszędzie jest mowa o tym, że można część środków stracić jako Nominator. Jak wyliczać ryzyko utraty części środków? Czy jest to w ogóle możliwe aby oszacować możliwą stratę? Jeśli NIE to jak system wylicza tą stratę ile obciąć środków?

Odpowiedź: https://w3f-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polkadot/slashing/amounts.html

4. W Governance jest Democracy, Council, Tresury. Pare słów o możliwościach. Czy partycypacja w tych funkcjonalnościach może być obligatoryjna czy jest tylko opcjonalna?

Odpowiedź: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance

5. Dla developerów widzę już wiele funkcjonalności - na czym one polegają? czy to głównie łączenie różnych blockchainów przez relay chain?
6. W opisie Polkadot widzę "Polkadot enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens." Jeśli nie tylko tokeny to co jeszcze mozna transferować pomiędzy blockchainami? Jakieś przykłady?
7. Walidatorów może być ograniczona liczba, rozumiem że obecnie 600, domyślnie 1000? Natomiast Nominatorów może być dowolna ilość? Choćby tylu ilu posiadaczy KSM/DOT?
8. Jak się ma relay chain Polkadot do relay chain Kusama? Czy to ten sam relay chain czy zupełnie różne?
9. Czy w opłatach za używanie KSM/DOT nie musi być uwzględniona łączna opłata za korzystanie zarówno z sieci KSM/DOT jak również za transakcje w sieciach (blockchainach) w których będą realizowały się jakieś transakcje, np. BTC i ETH ?

# SBM vol. #19 - Plasm Network [Polkadot] - Hoon Kim

<p align="center">
  <img src="./_PREVIOUS_MEETUPS/28-05-2020-PlasmNetwork/plasm-network.png">
</p>

## :memo: Agenda

This presentation will act as an introductory point to Plasm Network and Layer 2 scalability solutions as a whole. The contents include, what layer 2 is, what is an OVM, how it provides scalability, what Plasm Network is, what Parity Substrate framework is, what is a Parachain, and how all of this is implemented on Plasm Network.

## :rocket: Prelegent

Hoon Kim, a software engineer at Stake Technologies and a core developer of the Plasm Team.
Awarded Gold Prize at the 2014 South Korean National Olympiad in Informatics. Received the Outstanding Thesis award at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University for an undergraduate thesis regarding the applicability of a single purpose blockchain for stock exchanges and asset management (2020).
Graduated Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, degree of Bachelor of Business Administration at the College of International Management (2020).

## What is Plasm Network?

Plasm Network is a part (in the near future parachain) of Polkadot ecosystem based on Substrate framework. Main chain (relay chain) in Polkadot due to performance optimizations has only basic features without possibility to execute smart contracts. Plasm Network delivers possibility to working with smart contracts in Polkadot. Using Plasm Network software engineer will be able to deploy DApps on Layer 2 and build own decentralized applications.

## :question: Questions

0. First of all congrats for running mainnet! :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

0.5. What does Web3 mean for Plasm Network? ;-)

1. Are you going to have own DEX? What about the liquidity provider?

2. As an introduction, could you say about stack technology?

3. Let's talk about the roadmap, "Game development-focused DApps to allow game developers to leverage Plasm Networks’s Layer2 capabilities (ideally a game engine plugin that does not require the developer to know anything about blockchains to use it in their games)." - could you describe a bit more about that, architecture, do you have some draft of API, or just now 'in run-time-meetup' to propose API for that :D ? 

4. What is Dusty network?

5. Polkadot delivers security, pow, consensus and runtime upgrades, so why Plasm Network requires additional validators? Why is that?

6. As added value of Plasm Network is "Dapps as a business", but what is the difference (taking into concideration the following quote):

> “Polkadot allows every coder to also be a businessman. They just place an algorithmic service online and it's a self-sovereign, autonomous, economically strong business. The world, in some sense, belongs to coders.” –– @gavofyork

Why not just:

> Parachain as a business? - Tomek :D :rocket:

7. There is any tocenomy connection between following tokens: DOT, PLM and maybe KSM?

8. "Good actors are rewarded by this mechanism whilst bad actors will lose their stake in the network" - any example for being good and bad actor? As an engineer I am really curious what "bad actor" means :D ?

9. There is any incentive for validator?

10. You are deeply tech guys but for normal people in Japan, what is the awerness of comming token economy? Could you say a few cents on that?

11. Shorty saying.. what milestones and the greatest issues you have while implementating?

12. What have you learnt currently during building parachain? Any advices and/or lessons learned?

13. What is the main advantage of Plasm over Polkadot - from developer point of view?

14. Could you share some your OWN thought on 'scalling Ethereum'?

## :memo: Agenda

One major difference in trading Bitcoin options at the moment is the price. Bitcoin is one of—if not the most—volatile asset trading at this time, meaning to buy an option is very expensive. During the meetup we will talk about:

- Available Bitcoin options

- Explaining of CALL and PUT options

- Implied volatility

- Simple strategies and explaining what options offers

<details><summary>More about Hegic Protocol</summary>
<br>
On April 23rd, Hegic announced the V1 launch of its protocol, which allows users to buy or sell American put/call options on Ethereum. We first wrote about Hegic on March 20th in our Thematic Report on Insurance Products. In that report, we also highlighted Opyn, a similar on-chain options protocol. What differentiates Hegic though, is how it writes (sells) options by implementing liquidity pools.

Hegic has two types of users - 1) holders of options (buyers) and 2) liquidity providers (sellers). When traders typically sell an option contract, the risk they're exposed to is limited to that specific contract. With Hegic, however, the goal is to diversify that risk across all of the liquidity providers for a given pool. Rather than having a single trader be exposed to the risk of a single contract, LPs now share the risk and reward for all contracts issued off their pool. The tables shown below from Hegic's whitepaper illustrate this principal.

</p>

A Hegic token is also expected to launch soon, which will be entitled to protocol settlement fees in contrast to the option premiums that LPs earn. In addition, the token will be used for governance and it'll give option buyers a discount on premiums paid (initially 30%) if the value of the tokens they hold exceeds the value of the contract they want to purchase.

While certainly an interesting idea, will Hegic's design prove to be an innovation with material benefits? This will depend on a variety of factors. How will yields compare to other liquidity pools? How will prices compare to other options exchanges? What is the true risk profile of being a liquidity provider? To answer these questions, our team will be doing a deep dive into the protocol to conduct further analysis. We'll keep our members posted.

# SBM vol. #17 - Smart Contract Security Verification Standard - Damian Rusinek

## :memo: Agenda

The presentation focuses on the whole process of security testing and present it by analogies to the web applications which are quite well-known. It covers the whole SDLC and show the similarities and differences in the arsenal of vulnerabilities, security tools and standards between the smart contracts and web applications on each step. Even though there exist a lot of great security projects for smart contracts, we do not have single, widely accepted security standard (such as ASVS in web apps world). That is why we introduce SCSVS (Smart Contract Security Verification Standard), a open-source 13-part checklist created to standardize the security of smart contracts for developers, architects, security reviewers and vendors.

## :rocket: Prelegent

## :question: Questions

0. Is it true that last update was two years ago (SCSVS)?

1. Do you update SCSVS when new features arrives to Solidity?

2. What you think abotu formal verification? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution)

3. SCSVS analyses source code or byte code executed on EVM?

4. Have you considered to write similar tool to another chain?

5. SCSVS is completely open source or there are some closed parts?

6. There is any business model? Is it profitable? ;-) #nofreelunch

7. Do you have some thoughts on Eth2.0? Do you know whether smart contracts will need migrate? Rewrite?

8. Which database do you use to keep state? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme)

9. 'if you implement randomness correctly' - could you explain it?

10. 'front running in context of security' ?

# SBM vol. #15 - BIP324 oraz BIP150 - Bartłomiej (Tony) Sanak

## :memo: Agenda

Anonimowość - Czy jej brak w Bitcoinie?

Poruszymy braki w anonimowości sieci Bitcoin, jak najłatwiej przeprowadzić "atak" by znaleźć dodatkowe informacje o transakcjach i użytkownikach. Czy developerzy Bitcoina starają się zapobiec tym atakom, i w jaki sposób? Porozmawiamy o kilku propozycjach i sposobach przywrócenia anonimowości, jak

-BIP324 - kodowanie wiadomości na warstwie P2P

-BIP150 - autentykacja połączeń P2P

-Dandelion - jak sprawić by transakcje zakwitły?

-Coinjoin (zerolink) - w jaki sposób wysyłać transakcje by nie narazić się na stratę prywatności

-SNICKER - mixowanie coinów bez interakcji?

## :rocket: Prelegent

Bartłomiej (Tony) Sanak jest programistą oraz fanem Bitcoina jako środka do osiągnięcia anonimowości w płatnościach. Na co dzień pracuje w firmie zajmującej się analityką w sieci Bitcoin, w szczególności wykrywaniem nielegalnych aktywności używających Bitcoina. Po pracy zmienia strony i interesuje się systemami anonimizacji transakcji oraz skalowalnością Bitcoina (LightningNetwork). Bartłomiej jest także guest-writerem dla BitcoinMagazine, pisze o tematyce technologii. Na co dzień mieszka w Vancouver i udziela się w lokalnych grupach promujących Bitcoina, w przeszłości co-organizował Crypto@Cracow meetup.

## :question: Questions

:zero: Jak żyć? 

:two: Adam Back - A New Language for Blockchains @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS47YxwxAMI <details><summary>Simplicity</summary>

Simplicity, który jest czymś w rodzaju "Assemblera" dla blockchain. W Bitcoinie może się pojawić w 2020+ roku.

Z tego co rozumiem jest to kontynuacja projektu MAST. Język ten jest ogólnie o wiele prostszy od Scripta, ale bazuje na bardzo podstawowych wartościach, więc można z tych "małych cegiełek" tworzyć bardzo różne inteligentne kontrakty, jeśli dobrze wychwyciłem to jest nawet pomysł wprowadzenia zkSnarks, czyli anonimowych transakcji.

Ogólnie Simplicity jest bardzo wydajnym językiem i lekkim (interpreter ma 15KB), programy wydawane przez niego są matematycznie udowadnialne (Podobno bardzo rzadka dziedzina informatyki, można wyliczyć ile pamięci zużyje program itd.).

W przyszłości może znieść potrzebę stosowania Soft Forków, gdyż można po prostu wrzucić kod Simplicity do blockchaina i węzły mające jego obsługę będą mogły go wykorzystywać, co pozwoli o wiele szybciej wprowadzać zmiany w Bitcoinie.

Może podnieść też bezpieczeństwo, np. chroniąc przed złodziejami, gdzie jest system warunków, w której ludzie mogą głosować (?), by złodziejowi nie wysyłać pieniędzy. Tak więc potencjalnie giełdy będą mogły z cold walletów zrezygnować.

Jeśli dobrze zrozumiałem to kod jaki ma być wykonywany (wcześniej podpisany?) nie musi być wysyłany w całości. Powiedzmy, że mamy kod, który wyda nam środki jeśli 2 klucze podpiszą transakcje lub 1 klucz i poczekanie 5000 bloków. Jak rozumiem w Scripts trzeba było taki kontrakt wrzucić na blockchain, a w Simplicity tylko interesujący nas fragment, co pozwoli zredukować ilość marnującej się powierzchni w blokach

## :rocket: Prelegent - Cezary "lightning" Dziemian

Jestem programistą z kilkunastoletnim stażem. Zacząłem w liceum od sprzedawania własnych programów na Allegro. Oprócz tego, że pracowałem na etat udało mi się po drodze spłodzić parę fajnych rzeczy jak np. grę Milionerzy Gold Edition, czy bota do automatycznego udzielania pożyczek w serwisie Kokos.pl. Swoją przygodę z Bitcoinem rozpocząłem w 2013 roku w momencie zamknięcia platformy Silkroad przez organy ścigania USA. Początkowo nie angażowałem się w tematykę kryptowalut jako programista. Zachowywałem zdrowy sceptycyzm, ze względu na niską skalowalność jak i konieczność oczekiwania na potwierdzenia transakcji. Uważałem, ze istnieją szanse na rozwój ale nie tak duże, by z krypto wiązać swoją karierę zawodową. Przełom nastąpił gdy w roku 2016 zapoznałem się z technologią o nazwie Lightning Network. Uznałem wówczas, że istnieje całkiem spora szansa na to, że jednak kiedyś w przyszłości krytpowaluty będą nadawały się do płacenia. Od tego momentu zaangażowałem się dość mocno. Założyłem stronę lightningnetwork.pl by podzielić się z innymi ludźmi swoim odkryciem. Później powstała też grupa na Facebooku. Udało mi się również zaimplementować LN na giełdzie BTCDuke, czyniąc tą giełdę pierwszą na świecie, która przyjmuje zarówno wpłaty jak i wypłaty przy użyciu Lightning Network. Stworzyłem również stronę ln.zone, pomagającą tym, którzy chcą przyjmować płatności przy użyciu LN.

## :page_with_curl: Description

Lightning is a decentralized network using smart contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant payments across a network of participants. How it Works. The Lightning Network is dependent upon the underlying technology of the blockchain.

## :question: Questions

:zero: Znasz może serwis w stylu BTC as a service? Wrzucony blockchain do SQL i można odpalać na takiej bazie zapytania SQL?

:one: Jak lepiej instalować LN - za pomocą Docker czy kompilując (make)? - wady i zalety

:two: Parę lat temu mowiło się, że LTC będzie srebrnym BTC, środowiskiem testowym dla wszystkich większych funkcjonalności dla BTC, czy nie uważasz, że LTC zatrzymało się - rozwój LN dla LTC zatrzymał się mówiąc wprost?

:three: Jest parę implementacji LN (C-Lightning czy lnd), czy polecasz którą? Wiesz może jakie są różnice między nimi?

:four: Co sądzi o Channel Factory? Czy i kiedy to może wejść i czy w ogolę ktoś coś już tworzy w tym kierunku?

:five: Anonimizacja a LN, czy to jest dobry moment na pytanie, czy LN zapewni anonimizację?

:six: Co sądzisz o BIP324?

:seven: BTC a PoS?

:eight: Anonimowość a LN?

:nine: Omówienie pliku konfiguracyjnego LN:

<details><summary>Lightning node customization options</summary>


*rgb*='RRGGBB'::
    Your favorite color as a hex code.

*alias*='NAME'::
    Up to 32 UTF-8 characters to tag your node.  Completely silly, since anyone
    can call their node anything they want.  The default is an
    NSA-style codename derived from your public key, but "Peter Todd"
    and "VAULTERO" are good options, too.

*fee-base*='MILLISATOSHI'::
    Default: 1000.  The base fee to charge for every payment which passes
    through.  Note that millisatoshis are a very, very small unit!
    Changing this value will only affect new channels and not existing ones.
    If you want to change fees for existing channels, use the RPC call
    lightning-setchannelfee(7).

*fee-per-satoshi*='MILLIONTHS'::
    Default: 10 (0.001%).  This is the proportional fee to charge for every
    payment which passes through.  As percentages are too coarse, it's in
    millionths, so 10000 is 1%, 1000 is 0.1%.  Changing this value will only
    affect new channels and not existing ones.  If you want to change fees for
    existing channels, use the RPC call lightning-setchannelfee(7).

*min-capacity-sat*='SATOSHI'::
    Default: 10000.  This value defines the minimal effective channel capacity
    in satoshi to accept for channel opening requests.  If a peer tries to open
    a channel smaller than this, the opening will be rejected.

*ignore-fee-limits*='BOOL'::
    Allow nodes which establish channels to us to set any fee they
    want.  This may result in a channel which cannot be closed, should
    fees increase, but make channels far more reliable since we never
    close it due to unreasonable fees.

*commit-time*='MILLISECONDS::
    How long to wait before sending commitment messages to the peer: in
    theory increasing this would reduce load, but your node would have to be
    extremely busy node for you to even notice.

`
Lightning channel and HTLC options
`

*watchtime-blocks*='BLOCKS'::
    How long we need to spot an outdated close attempt: on opening a channel
    we tell our peer that this is how long they'll have to wait if they perform
    a unilateral close.

*max-locktime-blocks*='BLOCKS'::
    The longest our funds can be delayed (ie. the longest *watchtime-blocks*
    our peer can ask for, and also the longest HTLC timeout we will accept).
    If our peer asks for longer, we'll refuse to create a channel, and if an
    HTLC asks for longer, we'll refuse it.

*funding-confirms*='BLOCKS'::
    Confirmations required for the funding transaction when the other side
    opens a channel before the channel is usable.

*commit-fee*='PERCENT'::
    The percentage of 'estimatesmartfee 2' to use for the bitcoin
    transaction which funds a channel: can be greater than 100.

*commit-fee-min*='PERCENT'::
*commit-fee-max*='PERCENT'::
    Limits on what onchain fee range we'll allow when a node opens a
    channel with us, as a percentage of 'estimatesmartfee 2'.  If
    they're outside this range, we abort their opening attempt.  Note
    that *commit-fee-max* can (should!) be greater than 100.

*max-concurrent-htlcs*='INTEGER'::
    Number of HTLCs one channel can handle concurrently in each direction.
    Should be between 1 and 483 (default 30).

*cltv-delta*='BLOCKS'::
    The number of blocks between incoming payments and outgoing payments:
    this needs to be enough to make sure that if we have to, we can close
    the outgoing payment before the incoming, or redeem the incoming once
    the outgoing is redeemed.

*cltv-final*='BLOCKS'::
    The number of blocks to allow for payments we receive: if we have to,
    we might need to redeem this on-chain, so this is the number of blocks
    we have to do that.

Invoice control options:

*autocleaninvoice-cycle*='SECONDS'::
    Perform cleanup of expired invoices every 'SECONDS' seconds, or
    disable if 0.  Usually unpaid expired invoices are uninteresting,
    and just take up space in the database.

*autocleaninvoice-expired-by*='SECONDS'::
    Control how long invoices must have been expired before they are
    cleaned (if 'autocleaninvoice-cycle' is non-zero).

~19.45 Zakończenie spotkania

## Prelegent

Przemek Kowalczyk

Przemek Kowalczyk is a programmer, econophysicist, and entrepreneur. Formerly a Machine Learning specialist at Boston Consulting Group, Przemek first got involved in blockchain technology while publishing a proposal for a decentralized p2p lending network. He co-established Blockchain Hub Warsaw (http://bhwarsaw.org), a foundation connecting Poland’s leading blockchain teams (including Golem, Ramp and MakerDAO).
In 2017 he co-founded Ramp out of a passion for decentralization and freedom, also has built the first prototype of open banking-blockchain connection. Since then, he is concentrated solely on leading Ramp product team, on the mission of disrupting the centralised fiat-to-crypto exchanges market.

## Description

Ramp Instant - building user-friendly, trust-minimised, fiat to crypto onramp

We now finally see DApps built with a broad audience in mind. It seems we are on the verge of mass adoption, yet we did not nail the most important element of the adoption puzzle: how to onboard a user that doesn’t have any crypto?

The onboarding process is a real pain, as it typically takes nearly 30 steps to complete. Plus, all of the popular onramps today are centralised and custodial. We at Ramp made an attempt to build an easy to use, non-custodial on-ramp that with time can get decentralised.

I will talk about why on-ramps matter, what are the trade-offs of different types of on-ramps and finally present our newest attempt to build the perfect onramp: Ramp Instant, built with smart contracts on top of open banking APIs, meant to boost adoption and soothe onboarding pains.

## Questions

1. What is the impact of 'comming' Ethereum 2.0 for Ramp? There is a need for any migration etc. ?

# Sigma

Sigma (Σ) Protocol completely removes the need for a trusted setup, which is a major milestone for any privacy coin. In this design, RSA Accumulators which had previously been used for Zerocoin are replaced with Elliptic Curve Groups. As a side effect, Zerocoin proof sizes are reduced from 25 kB to around 1 kB and mint sizes cut by 75%, making Zerocoin much more scalable. Furthermore, it significantly enlarges anonymity sets (to >16,000 [tbd.]) and increases overall security. The latter is achieved by introducing 256-bit elliptic curves which, in terms of security, are roughly equivalent to 3072-bit RSA as opposed to 2048-bit RSA in use by Zerocoin before.

# Questions

1. In the link: https://medium.com/beam-mw/mimblewimble-beam-roadmap-2019-b2c7f38fc106 is written "To increase adoption and let people run Beam node and wallet on more platforms, such as Rust programming language". Does it mean BEAM will be implemented in Rust? If so what is the advantage of Rust?

2. BEAM wants to change PoW algorithm two times, why? Why DAG like: http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/ghostdag/ ?

3. What is the difference between Tor and I2P network?

4. BEAM is going to implement PoS and/or master nodes?

5. In MW there are no address. So for what block explorer?

21.00 Zakończenie spotkania oraz networking, after kawa i/lub piwo.


Podczas prezentacji zostaną poruszone tematy powiązane z rozliczaniem kryptowalut w Polsce dla osób fizycznych:
1. Kryptowaluty do 2018 roku
 - Kryptowaluty a prawo.
 - Jak traktować hard-forki, środki z programów partnerskich, transakcje na rynku krypto-krypto?
 - Prowizja przychodem?
 - W jaki sposób należy rozliczyć dochód/stratę za rok 2018?
 - Strata - czy muszę wykazać? Czy pomniejszy moje podatki?
2. Zmiany w prawie w zakresie kryptowalut obowiązujące od roku 2019
 - Omówienie zmian.
 - Dlaczego stable-coiny mogą pełnić użyteczną rolę względem podatków?
 - Dalsze problemy pomimo zmian.
3. O systemie rozliczkryptowaluty.pl
 - W jaki sposób narzędzie ułatwia rozliczanie?
 - W jaki sposób wypełnić formularz PIT na podstawie raportu?

Łukasz Skonieczny – przedstawiciel serwisu [rozliczkryptowaluty.pl](https://rozliczkryptowaluty.pl). Pasjonat nowych technologii, przedsiębiorca, programista i automatyk. Niejasności prawne i problemy związane z kryptowalutami w świetle podatków skłoniły go do zgłębienia tematu rozliczania kryptowalut. Ostatecznie, w odpowiedzi na brak dostępnych narzędzi, przy współpracy z [Grupą Profit Plus](https://gppsa.pl) postanowił stworzyć system do wspomagania rozliczeń transakcji kryptowalutowych [rozliczkryptowaluty.pl](https://rozliczkryptowaluty.pl).

Na naszych spotkania obowiązuje Berliński Kodeks Postępowania. Zapraszamy wszystkich uczestników i uczestniczki naszych wydarzeń do pomocy w tworzeniu przeżyć, które będą bezpieczne i pozytywne dla każdego.

Jeśli chcesz przekazać uczestnikom spotkania jakieś informacje - wystąpić z krótkim przemówieniem i pokazać ciekawą technologią, skrytykować jakieś rozwiązanie, zaprezentować swój projekt lub poinformować o jakiejś inicjatywie, prosimy o kontakt z organizatorami.

4. Propozycja zagadnień które warto poruszyć podczas następnych spotkań.

```
Me: crypto taxes?
Accountant: Sure.
Me: So if I bought BTC and then exchanged it for ETH to open a CDP and then used my DAI to buy more ETH... what do I owe?
Accountant: the government doesn't understand what you're talking about
```

## Pytania

1. (w nawiązaniu do whitepaper): "Second,  applications  such  as  Augur  have  attempted  tobring  real-world  data  onto  the  blockchain  in  a  decentral-ized  way—in  the  process  essentially  building  a  consensusmechanism  inside  smart  contracts  [8],  instead  of  utilizingthe consensus mechanism of the underlying blockchain. Thisleads  to  inefficiencies  but  doesn’t  increase  security." - o jakich nieefektywnościach w Augur mowa?

2. Aeon === AE ?

3. "Sidenote: Originally Aeternity intended to be a 100 percentproof-of-stake  blockchain.  We  don’t  think  anymore  that  adecentralized 100 percent PoS system is possible" - dlaczego nie?

4. Jaki jest status lekkiego klienta?

5. "Cross-chain atomic swaps:Cross   chain   atomicswaps allow for trustless exchange of aeon for bitcoins [14],[15]. These can be implemented using a hashlock, that locksthe transactions on both blockchains under the same value." - Aeternity może pracować jako side chain BTC?

6. Wymagania dla walidatorów? 

7. [INFO] Link do OPCODE's w white paper nie działa.

# Silesia Blockchain Meetup #7 - 16.01.2019

* Marcin Rabenda

* Maciej Oniszczuk

Malta

Malta jest określana europejskim centrum usług korporacyjnych. Najważniejszą jej zaletą jest fakt, że maltański system podatkowy oferuje między innymi:

korzyści dla rezydentów z poza Malty, których cały dochód jest zwolniony z opodatkowania,
legalne funkcjonowanie kryptowalut oraz gier hazardowych zarówno stacjonarnych jak i online, pod ścisłą kontrolą urzędową ze strony Malta Gaming Authority,
zwrot 6/7 zapłaconego podatku CIT w terminie kilku miesięcy od dnia jego rozliczenia. W ten sposób faktyczna stawka podatku CIT ulega obniżeniu do 5 %, a jednocześnie wysoka stawka nominalna (35%) pozwala na ominięcie reguł CFC dot. zagranicznych spółek kontrolowanych.
w przypadku dochodu z praw własności intelektualnej stawka efektywna może spaść nawet do 0%,
korzyści dla polskich rezydentów wynikają z korzystnych zapisów naszej umowy o unikaniu podwójnego opodatkowania z Maltą,
najpopularniejszą w Europie i jedna z najpopularniejszych na świecie bander, która pozwala przy spełnieniu określonych wymogów na zwolnienie od podatku całego dochodu uzyskiwanego z ich późniejszego komercyjnego czarteru.
Cypr

Przez długie lata Cypr uchodził w Polsce niemal za synonim raju podatkowego. Popularność Cypru spadła wraz z ograniczeniem zwolnień oraz w skutek kryzysu finansowego i bankowego na wyspie w latach 2012-2013. Obecnie kraj ten ponownie zyskuje na popularności wśród polskich przedsiębiorców, a jest ku temu kilka powodów.

Po kryzysie na rynku nieruchomości wzrosło zainteresowanie przecenionymi oraz wyprzedawanymi przez banki działkami oraz willami, co z kolei skłoniło wiele zamożnych osób do przeprowadzki i w konsekwencji na zmianę swojej rezydencji podatkowej na słoneczny Cypr, gdzie kwota wolna od podatku jest 26 razy wyższa niż w Polsce.
Kolejny powód to fakt, że mimo podwyżki stawki CIT z 10 do 12,5 %, dalej jest to jedna z najniższych stawek w Europie, a cypryjski system podatkowy dalej jest jednym z najlepszych w Unii Europejskiej.
Nie bez znaczenia pozostaje fakt, że anglosaski system prawny Cypru obowiązuje nie tylko kiedy chodzi o kierownicę po lewej stronie, ale także gwarantując anonimowy trust funkcji dyrektora i udziałowca w spółce LTD, zachowujący anonimowość faktycznego beneficjenta.
Wielu naszych klientów jest zaskoczonych, kiedy dowiadują się, że póki pozostają rezydentami podatkowymi w Polsce to założenie firmy za granicą i czerpanie z niej dochodów co do zasady nie pozwoli na oszczędność osobistych podatków. Dotyczy to także co do zasady dochodu z zagranicznej firmy. Rezydencję podatkową można jednak zmienić
w dowolnym momencie. Osobom chcącym zmienić swoją rezydencję podatkową i w konsekwencji zaprzestać płacić podatki w Polsce mogą pomóc najnowsze zmiany w prawie Cypru. Wszystko zostanie przedstawiona na naszym szkoleniu.
